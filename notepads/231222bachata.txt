then having been once this




prayer for the day ahead
if you believe in the power of prayer, pray with me.


almighty father as we step into this new day,
let the wisdom of Daniel 11:32B guide us

infuse our hearts with divine strength and courage
for the adventures that await
bless us with discerning minds 
to navigate this day wisely
may our every action be a radiant reflection of your glory
connecting a story filled with purpose and grace
with the assurance of your loving guidance
we embark on this day inspired and confident 

we pray in the mighty name of Jesus 
Amen
