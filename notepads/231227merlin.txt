another bug:
  inputting allows END to be less than BEGIN.

  T is allowed to be less than 5 mins


If realism is a type of mastery, you will need multiple 10 hour days a week for at least 4 years.
If good enough is more what you're aiming for, multiple 10 hour days a week for at least 1 year only will have come with constant dissatisfaction and end knowing that you quit too soon.
No written description will be of much help considering the intuitions built on the way to mastery.
