jhonatan - 

Hi Johnatan,

My name is Jeong, I'm a 30 year old 176cm, athletic Korean male.
I will start Bachata Beginner series when I return to London for work on Jan 10th.
I looked at some essential positions, but I am a complete beginner!
I have black trousers and reasonable shoes.

Could you accept a beginner lead for Saturday this week, and then Tuesday next week?
The Event page shows a Wednesday session, but the form does not include these.
Are the Wednesday sessions still running?
Or could you tell me if multiple slots per week is not allowed as I have 2 weeks left in Seoul :)

Thank you, 

Jeong
