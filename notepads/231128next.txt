    activity duration 3 sets tends to be 
        3sets of 
            1 min reps 
            2 min rest
        9 minutes at least for 3 sets 
        tends to 5 or 6 sets


    bt.min should be 5 minutes later than the previous activity 
    bt.max should be 15 minutes before the next activity
        because 
            bt - et : should be at least 10 minutes.
                et.max is 5 mins before next activity.
    et.min should be 10 minutes after bt.
        request option to change minimum activity duration
            reject - just schedule another 10 minute activity.
                if you are doing intense enough sets to require 2 minute rest minimum and doing minimum 3 sets of each but are alternating activities, put them adjacent to eachother.

    et.max should be 5 minutes before the next activity that day.
