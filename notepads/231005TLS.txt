unclear which of the following if both were set at the beginning of getting express to install properly.
$ env >> linux env variables 
    NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
        toggle this between 1 and 0
            $ export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
$ npm config list >> npm env variables
    strict-ssl = false 
        toggle between true and false
            $ npm config set strict-ssl true
